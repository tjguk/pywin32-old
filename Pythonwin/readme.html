<H2>Introduction </H2>
<P>Pythonwin is implemented as a 'wrapper' for the Microsoft Foundation Class library. With it, you can use MFC in an interactive, interpreted environment, or write full blown stand-alone applications tightly coupled with the Windows environment. Over 30 MFC objects are exposed, including Common Controls, Property Pages/Sheets, Control/Toolbars, Threads, etc. </P>
<P>Pythonwin could almost be considered a sample program for the MFC UI environment. This Python UI environment can be embedded in almost any other application - such as OLE clients/servers, Netscape plugins, as a Macro language etc. </P>
<P>Pythonwin now also comes with a built-in debugger.  This debugger was previously distributed separately as the <I>win32dbg</I> package, but has recently been upgraded to use the new Scintilla color editor, and rolled into the main Pythonwin distribution.  <A HREF="pywin/debugger/doc/index.html">Please check out the debugger documentation</A>.</P>
<P><A HREF="#RecentChanges">Recent changes can be found at the end of this document</A>.</P>
<P><A HREF="pythonwin.txt">The log from the source control system is also included.</A></P>
<H2>Demos</H2>
<P>There are many demos in the pywin\demos directory. To see a list of all the demos, run the program "pywin\demos\guidemo.py" from inside Pythonwin.</P>
<H2>Documentation </H2>
<P>Almost all win32ui methods are document in the Pythonwin Help file. This is available from the Help Menu in the Pythonwin enviroment.</P>
<P>Below is a list of external Pythonwin specific documentation. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Check out documentation on <A HREF="doc/guienvironment.html">the Pythonwin GUI environment</A> </LI>
<LI>For a brief description of how to embed win32ui.pyd into your MFC application see the <A HREF="doc/EmbeddingWin32ui.html">embedding win32ui documentation</A>. </LI>
<LI>There is some general documentation on the <A HREF="doc/architecture.html">MFC Architecture</A> and more specifically, <A HREF="doc/docview.html">document and view architecture</A>. </LI>
<LI>A Reference Manual of all available MFC functions etc. is released as a Windows Help file with the main Pythonwin release. </LI>
<LI>Check out the demos, and the source code to the Pythonwin environment.</LI></UL>

<H2>Known Problems</H2>

<UL>
<LI>The new Scintilla control has a few issues regarding scrolling and caret positioning which are quite minor. VSS integration currently loses the selection when checking out the file. </LI>
<LI>Pythonwin will occasionally crash upon exiting under Windows 95. The crash is in "user.exe" (Windows 95 16 bit code) which makes debugging difficult. It does not happen on Windows NT, so I'm stumped on this one. If someone could even just narrow it down to exactly what code will cause the crash at exit I would really appreciate it. </LI>
<LI>Many of the menu items are always grey (eg, Print, Print Preview, Set Tab Stops, etc). This functionality is simply not yet implemented in Pythonwin. </LI>
<LI>Triple quoting of strings, and the 'underscore feature' of Python.exe are not implemented in the interactive window. </LI>
<LI>Printing strings will NULL bytes will cause problems.</LI></UL>

<H2><A NAME="RecentChanges">Recent Changes</A></H2>
<P>New, improved color editor, using the Scintilla control by Neil Hodgson (see <A HREF="http://hare.net.au/~neilh/ScintillaTide.html">http://hare.net.au/~neilh/ScintillaTide.html</A>). The debugger now requires use of this editor.</P>
<P>Much better printing support from Roger Burnham. Pythonwin itself still can't print anything, but the framework can (meaning some kind soul could now add the support to Pythonwin :-)</P>
<P>DDE support is complete.</P>
<P>Reference helpfile is far more complete.</P>
<P>Lots of new methods from Kleanthis Kleanthous.</P>
<P>Better tool-tip and region support</P>
