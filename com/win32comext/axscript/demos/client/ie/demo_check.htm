<H1>Engine Registration</H1>

<BODY>

The Python ActiveX Scripting Engine is not currently registered.  Before any of the supplied demos will work, the engine must be successfully registered.

<P>If you are seeing this page because you just installed the Microsoft Script Debugger
for internet explorer, then I am afraid you need to upgrade the debugger.  You can find
a debugger for MSIE3.02 at <A HREF="ftp://www.python.org/ftp/python/pythonwin/MSIE3DBG.EXE">www.python.org (MSIE3DBG.EXE - 1503k)</A>
<P>To install the engine, the Python program <CODE>win32com\axscript\client\pyscript.py</CODE> must be run.  You can either do this manually, or follow the instructions below.

<H2>Register the engine now!</H2>
You can register the engine very simply.  Just follow the process outlined below:
<OL>
  <LI>Click on the link below
  <LI><B>A dialog will be presented asking if the file should be opened or saved to disk.  Select "Open it".</B>
  <LI>A Console program will briefly open, while the server is registered.
</OL>

<P><A HREF="..\..\..\client\pyscript.py">Register the engine now</A>

<H2>Checking the registration</H2>
After the registration is complete, simply hit the Reload button.  If the 
registration was successful, the page will change to the Python/AvtiveX Demo Page.
